## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you believe you have found a security vulnerability in the plugin, we highly appreciate your responsible disclosure. To report a security vulnerability, please follow these steps:

2. **Privately Notify Us**: Please send an email to [security@sekretservices.com](mailto:security@sekretservices.com) with all the details regarding the vulnerability you discovered.
3. **Include Details**: In your email, provide a clear description of the vulnerability, the steps to reproduce it, and any relevant supporting information such as affected versions or configurations.
4. **Encryption**: To encrypt your message, you can use our PGP key. Please request our PGP key in the initial email, and we will send it to you.
5. **Acknowledgment**: After receiving your report, we will acknowledge the receipt of the vulnerability report as soon as possible and within 48 hours.
6. **Assessment**: W will assess and investigate the reported vulnerability to verify its validity and impact.
7. **Fix and Disclosure**: Once the vulnerability is verified and fixed, we will release an update addressing the issue. We will provide proper credit to you for responsible disclosure if you desire. We will also publish a security advisory to inform users of the vulnerability.

## Issue Template (Optional)

If you prefer to submit the vulnerability report as an issue on our repository, please follow these guidelines:
